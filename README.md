# LDE MVP Demo

## What is LDE?  
LDE stands for **Learning, Development, and Earning**. It is a technical name for a prototype mobile system designed to deliver stable, powerful resource management and workload distribution on Android devices.

## Project Overview  
LDE is a **stability-first system** that prevents app crashes by budgeting device resources precisely and transparently showing daily usage in megabytes (MB). It controls RAM, ROM, CPU, and message caps dynamically across Free, Battery, and Pro tiers to ensure smooth, crash-free operation especially on low-end devices.

## Stabilization: LDE’s Core Specialty  
Many mobile apps crash often due to uncontrolled resource usage causing device overloads. LDE solves this by **enforcing strict daily and device-level quotas** for memory, storage, CPU, and message quota caps, proven in the demo to keep workloads stable and within safe limits. This stabilization allows even resource-intensive distributed and file processing tasks to run reliably without crashes.

## Real-World Monetization Analogy  
Several popular apps implement **auto-recharge-like subscription models**, granting users enhanced capabilities upon payment. LDE mimics this by integrating RevenueCat entitlements, instantly adjusting device resource caps and usage quotas when users upgrade tiers—ensuring fair resource use matched to payments while maintaining stability.

## Core Innovations and Features  

### Distributed Processing System (DPS)  
DPS enables multiple devices to share and balance computational workloads safely, increasing user computing power beyond usual limits without sacrificing stability.

### File Processing System (FPS)  
FPS manages file read/write tasks within strict daily resource budgets, ensuring large data processing jobs do not overwhelm device storage or memory.

### Virtual Stability Tiers System (VSTS)  
VSTS automatically applies resource and workload caps based on user tier (Free, Battery, Pro), optimizing performance and stability while enabling tier-based monetization.

## Why LDE Matters  
- Prevents frequent app crashes on constrained devices.  
- Empowers users with stronger, stable performance via smarter workload distribution and resource budgeting.  
- Links monetization directly to resource entitlement, creating a sustainable revenue path for developers.

## How to Run on Android  
1. Open Pydroid 3 app.  
2. Open `lde_cli.py` in the Editor tab.  
3. Tap “Run” to execute the demo and view real-time output in the console.  
4. (Advanced) Run from Terminal:  



## Demo Flow  
- Start on Free tier: cap 25 messages, 500MB ROM, 256MB RAM, standard CPU.  
- Explainer answers a question; counts toward daily usage and credits.  
- Battery tier boosts caps to 100 messages, 2000MB ROM, 1024MB RAM, high CPU.  
- Pro tier unlocks max caps at 200 messages, 5000MB ROM, 2048MB RAM, max CPU instantly on entitlement.  
- Process Data Service simulates ~0.98 MB data reads per day, updating totals in realtime.  
- Stress compute writes ~0.06 MB today with controlled CPU and I/O load.  
- 7-day history tracks rollover for usage auditing (empty on first run).  
- RevenueCat entitlement manages instant tier upgrades with real-time cap and feature switching.
